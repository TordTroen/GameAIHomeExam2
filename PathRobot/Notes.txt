### Why
- If the enemy is in an obstacle node, the robot will path to one of the neighbours 
	- that waythe robot is guaranteed have a node to path to, because in the given collision map every node has atleast one neighbour (including diagonal neighbours) is a non-obstacle node


### TODO
- Use better data structures for the A*
	- A priority queue or a min-heap of some sort for the frontier container so we don't have to go through it at every step in the search
- Can probably avoid the closed list if we add a field to the MapNode
